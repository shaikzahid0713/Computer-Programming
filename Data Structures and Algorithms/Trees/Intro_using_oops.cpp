   Binary Trees: 
      A tree consisting of at most two nodes. 

      Binary Tree types: 
         1. Full Binary Tree 
               - Every node either has 0 or 2 children. 
         2. Complete Binary Tree
               - All levels are completely filled
               - Last level has all nodes on left as possible.
         3. Perfect Binary Tree 
               - All leaf nodes are at the same level.
         4. Balanced Binary Tree    
               - Height of the tree at max of log2(n) for given n nodes.
         5. Degenerate Binary Tree 
               - Skew tree(Linked List)
